# Word-Mover-s-Distance.
Finding similarity between two sentences using Word-Mover-s-Distance algorithm

# Description
This algorithm allows transfer every word from sentence-1 to sentence-2 because algorithm does not know which word of sentence-1 should be transfer to which word of sentence-2. At the end it will choose the minimum transportation cost to transport every word from sentence-1 to sentence-2.
Distance is inversely proportional to the similarity. If distance is less then similarity is high and if distance is high then similarity is less.
